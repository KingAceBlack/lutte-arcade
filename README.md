Lutte Arcade is an onchain PvE adventure game where players progress through a map, ultimately completing the game by defeating the Final Boss.

Gameplay Overview

The gameplay loop is simple and easy to learn, divided into two phases: Offensive and Defensive.
In the Offensive phase, the player selects an attack and clicks the resolve button. The enemy is randomly assigned a defensive move, and the game resolves whether the attack was successful or not.
In the Defensive phase, the player selects a defensive move, while the enemy is randomly assigned an attack. The game then resolves whether the player's defense successfully evaded the enemy's attack.
The loop continues until either the player or the enemy dies.
